This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` component with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function.  The function is called multiple times for a single barcode, leading to unexpected behavior in your application. This is especially problematic when performing actions like navigation or data updates based on scanned barcodes. The issue seems to stem from the way Expo handles barcode detection events, potentially triggering multiple callbacks.
